We apply Theorem 1 in Freitas-Siksek's 2015 paper (JTNB) using q = 3 and 17.

The integer B for the number field Q(sqrt(13)) from Theorem 1 in Freitas-Siksek 
(JTNB, 2015) is:
1684800
Its prime factors are:
[ 2, 3, 5, 13 ]

We now apply Theorem 1 in Freitas-Siksek (JTNB, 2015) using q = 3, 17 (as in the
proof of Theorem 3 in loc. cit.).

The set of primes p such that p = 11 or p > 13 (and p does not divide B) for 
which reducibility may occur is:
{}
Using Theorem 1 in Freitas-Siksek (JTNB, 2015), this proves that irreducibility 
is missing only for p = 5,7,13.

We already know that E has good reduction at both primes Q1 and Q2 above 3 in 
Q(sqrt(13)). We compute the traces:
If a, b (mod 3) = 0 , 1 then (aQ1(E(a,b), aQ2(E(a,b))) =  [ -1, -3 ]
If a, b (mod 3) = 0 , 2 then (aQ1(E(a,b), aQ2(E(a,b))) =  [ -1, -3 ]
If a, b (mod 3) = 1 , 1 then (aQ1(E(a,b), aQ2(E(a,b))) =  [ -1, 1 ]
If a, b (mod 3) = 1 , 2 then (aQ1(E(a,b), aQ2(E(a,b))) =  [ -3, -1 ]
If a, b (mod 3) = 2 , 2 then (aQ1(E(a,b), aQ2(E(a,b))) =  [ -1, 1 ]
For each possible pair of traces (aQ1(E(a,b), aQ2(E(a,b))) we check whether the 
polynomials
(X^2 - aQ1(E(a,b))X + 3 (mod p), X^2 - aQ1(E(a,b))X + 3 (mod p)) for p = 5, 7, 
13
are irreducible.
Dealing with p = 5 and traces = [ -3, -1 ]
[ true, false ]
Dealing with p = 5 and traces = [ -1, -3 ]
[ false, true ]
Dealing with p = 5 and traces = [ -1, 1 ]
[ false, false ]
Dealing with p = 7 and traces = [ -3, -1 ]
[ false, true ]
Dealing with p = 7 and traces = [ -1, -3 ]
[ true, false ]
Dealing with p = 7 and traces = [ -1, 1 ]
[ true, true ]
Dealing with p = 13 and traces = [ -3, -1 ]
[ false, true ]
Dealing with p = 13 and traces = [ -1, -3 ]
[ true, false ]
Dealing with p = 13 and traces = [ -1, 1 ]
[ true, true ]
This shows that the mod p representation attached to E is also irreducible for p
= 5,7,13 except in the case p = 5 and trace of Frobenius at 3 equal to [-1,1].
Since if 3 | a + b, we have traces [-3,-1]. The result follows.
This proves Proposition 8.
