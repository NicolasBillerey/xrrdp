Done!
There are 6 forms not eliminated.

We check that these remaining forms correspond to the twists of Frey curves 
attached to trivial solutions as stated.
Done!
This proves part (1) of Proposition 4.

We finally prove Proposition 5: the traces of Frobenius at 3 is 4 for each 
elliptic curve E(x,y)^{(d)} that appears in Proposition 4.
Done!
Together with Proposition 1 (using W/Q), this proves Theorem 1.
