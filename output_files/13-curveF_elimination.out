The prime p = 5 survives for forms no 6, 9, 10, 13.
The prime p = 11 survives for forms no 6, 9, 10, 13 and 11, 15 respectively.

We use refined elimination to deal with these remaining forms/exponents

Dealing with form no 6 and exponent 5:
Performing refined elimination to eliminate exponent 5 with set of auxiliary 
primes [ 47 ]

Dealing with q = 47
The form is eliminated
*************************************************************


Dealing with form no 9 and exponent 5:
Performing refined elimination to eliminate exponent 5 with set of auxiliary 
primes [ 31 ]

Dealing with q = 31
The form is eliminated
*************************************************************


Dealing with form no 10 and exponent 5:
Performing refined elimination to eliminate exponent 5 with set of auxiliary 
primes [ 47 ]

Dealing with q = 47
The form is eliminated
*************************************************************


We have discarded exponent 5 for all forms, except for form no 13.


Dealing with form no 11 and exponent 11:
Performing refined elimination to eliminate exponent 11 with set of auxiliary 
primes [ 5 ]

Dealing with q = 5
The form is eliminated
*************************************************************


Dealing with form no 15 and exponent 11:
Performing refined elimination to eliminate exponent 11 with set of auxiliary 
primes [ 5 ]

Dealing with q = 5
The form is eliminated
*************************************************************


We have discarded exponent 11 for all forms.


This proves Theorem 2, except for p = 5 (form no 13 isn't eliminated for p = 5).


The unique pair (f,p) which is not eliminated is the pair (f,p) = (form no 13, 
5).
We deal with this case.

Using refined elimination with q = 11, 31 we check there is a unique prime ideal
P above 5 which survives.
The size of the residue fields of the primes in Qf13 above 5 are:
[ 125, 125, 5, 125, 125, 5, 125, 5 ]
The unique prime P above 5 which we cannot eliminate is: Prime Ideal of Of13
Two element generators:
    [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    [3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 4, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 4, 0, 2, 2, 0, 4]
We check that level raising cannot occur at q = 19, so that we can only care 
about the mod P congruence in the case of good reduction.
Done!

The pairs (a,b) mod 19 that make refined elimination fail mod P are 
[
    [ 1, 1 ],
    [ 1, 7 ],
    [ 1, 11 ],
    [ 2, 2 ],
    [ 2, 3 ],
    [ 2, 14 ],
    [ 3, 3 ],
    [ 3, 14 ],
    [ 4, 4 ],
    [ 4, 6 ],
    [ 4, 9 ],
    [ 5, 5 ],
    [ 5, 16 ],
    [ 5, 17 ],
    [ 6, 6 ],
    [ 6, 9 ],
    [ 7, 7 ],
    [ 7, 11 ],
    [ 8, 8 ],
    [ 8, 12 ],
    [ 8, 18 ],

    [ 14, 14 ],
    [ 15, 15 ],
    [ 16, 16 ],
    [ 16, 17 ],
    [ 17, 17 ],
    [ 18, 18 ]
]
We now compute the differences between the traces of Frobenius at 19 of E = 
E(a,b) and E(1,-1) for (a,b) in the list.
{ -22, -14 }
We observe that 0 is not in the previous list, completing the proof.
