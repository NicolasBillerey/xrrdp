We check that the surviving forms (for all p different from 7) at the level 
2^3*w^2 (i.e. when s = 3 in Lemma 7) correspond to solutions (1,-1,0) and 
(1,0,1).
Done!

For p = 7 the surviving forms correspond to the trivial solutions (1,-1,0) and 
(1,0,1) plus one extra form with quadratic field of coefficients Q(Sqrt(2)).
This completes the proof of Proposition 9 for the level 2^3*w^2.


We now check Remark 7.4.
Let g be the form not eliminated for p = 7

Do the traces at Q of g and E(1,-1) match mod P7' for Q of norm up to 5000?
false

Do the traces at Q of g and E(1,-1) match mod P7 for Q of norm up to 5000?
true

This non rational form seems to have a mod 7 representation isomorphic to that 
of the Frey curve attached to the trivial solution (1,-1,0)
