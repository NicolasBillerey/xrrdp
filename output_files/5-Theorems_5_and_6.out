Done!
There are 2 forms which are not eliminated (for any p) and four other forms 
which are eliminated only for p >= 11.

We check that the two forms which are not eliminated correspond to twists of 
Frey curves F/Q(sqrt(5)) attached to trivial solutions.

Done!
This proves part (2) of Proposition 4.

We check that the trace of Frobenius at 3 of these six newforms is 4.
Done!
Therefore, since F = F_{a,b} has good reduction at 3, we have a_3(F) = 4 (mod 
p).
We now compute the trace of Frobenius at 3 of F_{a,b}:
a = 0 b = 1 Trace of F at 3 = -2
a = 0 b = 2 Trace of F at 3 = -2
a = 1 b = 0 Trace of F at 3 = -2
a = 1 b = 1 Trace of F at 3 = 6
a = 1 b = 2 Trace of F at 3 = 4
a = 2 b = 0 Trace of F at 3 = -2
a = 2 b = 1 Trace of F at 3 = 4
a = 2 b = 2 Trace of F at 3 = 6
We see that F has trace 4 at 3 iff 3 | a +b.
According to Lemma 1, this implies that W/Q has mutliplicative reduction at 3.
Moreover, its mod p representation arises in level 2^4*5^2, 2^3*5^2, or 2*5^2.

Modular forms in these levels all correspond to (isogeny classes of) elliptic 
curves over Q.
We check that precisely 4 of them have trace of Frobenius at 3 which is -3 or 
+3.
Finally, we also show that these four elliptic curves have potentially good 
reduction at 5 and that the valuation of their minimal discriminant at 5 is 2 or
8:
Potentially good reduction at 5? true Valuation of minimal disc at 5 = 2
Potentially good reduction at 5? true Valuation of minimal disc at 5 = 8
Potentially good reduction at 5? true Valuation of minimal disc at 5 = 8
Potentially good reduction at 5? true Valuation of minimal disc at 5 = 2

This proves Theorem 5.

We now prove Theorem 6.
We denote by s a squareroot of 5.
